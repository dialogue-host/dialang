# Dialang

Dialang aims to fulfill [Dialogue's programming language requirements](https://github.com/dialogue-host/requirements/?tab=readme-ov-file#programming-language) by becoming a simple, reliable, safe, maintainable, purely functional programming language that runs anywhere and handles meta-programming, compile time parallelization, distributed storage and computation.
